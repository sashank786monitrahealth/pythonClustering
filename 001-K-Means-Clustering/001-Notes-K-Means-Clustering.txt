K-Means
=======
The very basic algorithm that is frequently used in clustering is K-Means. The K-Means is an algorithm that allow you to cluster your data points thereby allowing you to form certain groups of your data-points. <br/>

It is very convinient an effective tool for discovering categories and groups within your data that you would not have thought of otherwise yourself. <br/>


Step1: Choose the number K of Clusters<br/>
Step2: Select K points at random called centroids<br/>
Step3: Assign each datapoint to the nearest centroid. This will lead to K clusters<br/>
Step 4: Compute the new centroids of each cluster based on the datapoints it contains.<br/>
Step 5: Reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid.<br/>
     -- If there are some reassignments of datapoints took place then go to step 4, otherwise the process stops.<br/>
